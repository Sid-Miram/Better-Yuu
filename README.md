# Better-Yuu
---
##### It's all about you.

Hey, this project name is Yuu (you), and it's tagline is "It's all about you."

This project is about being Accountability Partner for each other and talking about anything that makes you better than yesterday; that could be saying what you feel, disscussion about life, taking advice, having philosophical discussions, discussing coping mechanisms, etc., and all that *Anonymously*.

We're welcoming all the people who are willing to change their lives, no matter what their current state is; that includes any of the following persons:
1. Ambitious
2. Lost 
3. Depressed
4. Anxious
5. ADHD
6. Optimistic
7. Pessimistic looking towards faraway land
8. Experts
9. Lonely
10. Etc. Etc. 

So you get the idea that we're looking for people who want to be content, productive, or _Just Being Yuu_ (the most important thing).

We differ from other social media because it's not about likes or followers; it's about the value we get from here.

So this was a simple explanation and theme about our website; now let's talk about it's Working.

##### *What's the point of living, if there is no end to it* 
## Working

There is going to be two sections:
1. Accountability Groups
2. Global Forums 

Let's deep dive into both of them, shall we? 




#### 1. Accountability Groups 

In this feature, we'll have the option to join at most two groups based on what is something we want to work on.
For example, if you're someone who wants to work upon studying a subject in your field or also wants to work upon your body. 

You'll choose your subject as a topic, and we'll place you with 3 other individuals who are studying the same thing. 
Same goes if you want to work upon your body.

Things to note:
1. You can join only 2 groups maximum for your betterment because... "If you chase two rabbits, you'll catch neither", but we let you join two instead ;)
2. A group is there only for 3 months, and after that, it's destroyed. You would be anonymous all the time in the group (so you can be yourself without worrying), and at the end of 3 months, if you liked all or some of your peers, you can add them as your friends and create a new group together with them.
Why this rule? We try to avoid Honeymoon phase,  wants everyone to be themselves without worrying about anything, even if it's their failure, so you can be transparent about your day in the group.
3. A group will have daily tasks according to what they're learning and will push each other to do them. That's why transparency, even if you fail, is a must. 
4. A group would consist of 4 people, of whom 1 would be ahead of others and would therefore be the mentor of that group.
*For example:* If you're an intermediate calisnethics guy and join a group, you'll be in a group with two more people at the same intermediate level as you and one advanced calisnethics guy. It could be three beginners and one intermediate guy too. 
He'll be monitoring others progress, and three others will monitor his.

*Process of Finding Mentors*: 
- By a quiz mandatory to be given by people who are joining group and are not beginners in that field. You can choose the option if you would like to be a mentor or not, and if you select it, you could be paired in a group as a mentor if there is a requirement for a mentor after the interview process we're going to do. Don't worry, it's only to check if you're a good fit for the role, which includes that you don't suffer yourself by helping others, being kind, etc. :).

#### 2. Global Forums
###TO BE CONTINUED...


Let's do the accountability groups functionality first.
